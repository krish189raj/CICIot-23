This repository contains code, preprocessing steps, and machine learning and deep learning models built using the CIC IoT 2023 Dataset,
1) Feature selection using genetic algorithm
2) Balancing using SMOTE-ENN
3) Also checked results before balancing 
4) Achieved a peak accuracy of arounf 99.25 percent using BiLSTM model.
5) Used SHAP and LIME for feature analysis

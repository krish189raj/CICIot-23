This repository contains code, preprocessing steps, and machine learning models built using the CIC IoT 2023 Dataset, a benchmark dataset for evaluating intrusion detection systems (IDS) in Internet of Things (IoT) environments.
he CIC IoT 2023 dataset, published by the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity (CIC), is designed for network intrusion detection in IoT systems. It captures a diverse range of attack and benign traffic, simulating realistic smart home and smart city scenarios.
